# HA-Domotic

See here my home automation... More details to come, but simply put, I purchase no overpriced IoT devices, I build everything with my own codes using ESPs and arduinos. Two basic protocols are to be used: MQTT and Modbus (being deprecated slowly). As off now, I got everything I want at much lower prices without depending on foreign companies with devices "calling home" to their manufacturer's servers and devices stopping working (planned obsolescence) or starting asking for fees...

There's two categories:

 - Devices:
   - Inlcudes the Arduino IDE code
   - Includes basic config for Home Assistant
   
 - Home Assistant:
   - Includes all configurations to help you reproduce what I did

If there's something not up to date, don't hesitate to contact me for latest version of a device or HA configuration
